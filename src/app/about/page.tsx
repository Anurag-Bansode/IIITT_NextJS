            The focus is to address the challenges faced by the Indian IT
            industry and growth of the domestic IT market, the Ministry of
            Human Resource Development(MHRD), Government of India has
            established Indian Institute of Information Technology
            Tiruchirappalli on a Not-for-profit Public Private Partnership
            (N-PPP) basis like 21 other IIITs.
            <br />
            A major objective in establishing IIIT Tiruchirappalli is to set
            up a model of education which can produce best-in-class human
            resources in IT and harnessing the multidimensional facets of IT
            in various domains. While the number of students produced would be
            small, the impact they create would be great.
            <br />
