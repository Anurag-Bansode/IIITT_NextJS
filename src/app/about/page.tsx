            The focus is to address the challenges faced by the Indian IT
            industry and the growth of the domestic IT market. The Ministry of
            Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India, has
            established IIIT Tiruchirappalli on a Not-for-profit Public Private
            Partnership (N-PPP) basis like 21 other IIITs.
            <br />
            A major objective in establishing IIIT Tiruchirappalli is to set up
            a model of education that produces best-in-class human resources in
            IT and harnesses the multidimensional facets of IT in various
            domains. While the number of students produced would be small, the
            impact they create would be great.
            <br />
            <br />
            As of June 14, 2021, IIIT Tiruchirappalli has started operating from
            its permanent campus at Sethurappatti. Before that, it operated from
            a temporary campus within the premises of Oxford Engineering
            College, Tiruchirappalli, and earlier within the premises of NIT
            Tiruchirappalli since March 2016.
